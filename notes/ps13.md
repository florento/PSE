## first step

for a pitch class $p$,  
a note $n$ (in the sequence of notes to spell),  
a note name $\ell$ (in A..G)

1. let $C(p, n)$ be the nb of occurrences of $p$ 
   in the $K_{pre}$ notes before $n$ and the $K_{post}$ after $n$.  
   This is a rough approx. of Krumhansl and Kessler approach to estimation of tonality.

2. let $L(p, n)$ be the name of $n$ in the chromatic harmonic scale of $p$.

3. let $N(\ell, n) =$ sum of $C(p, n)$ for all $p$ such that $L(p, n) = \ell$.

4. spell $n$ with $\ell$ maximizing  $N(\ell, n)$.

## second step
correct the non-diatonic moves of 1/2 ton.

## parameters
$K_{pre}$ and $K_{post}$ are parameters that have been fixed manually (about 32)  
on Meredith's PS dataset (a subset of Musedata).

## complexity
$O(n . K)$  
linear in nb of notes if $K_{pre}$ and $K_{post}$ fixed.
